# US Domestic Flights Visualization and Analysis 

This project is part of my internship portfolio and showcases my skills in data visualization, Python programming, and interactive dashboard creation.

## Project Overview

Using flight data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, I built an interactive dashboard and various visualizations to analyze domestic air travel patterns. The project focuses on:

- Outbound flight volume by airport
- Distance vs. average fare by airline market share
- Interactive geo plots using Plotly
- Dashboard rendering using Dash and Plotly Express

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Dash)
- Jupyter Notebook
- VSCode
- Git/GitHub

## Files

- `SemesterProject.ipynb` – Main report notebook with summary, visualizations, and insights
- `DomesticFlightsData.ipynb` – Code file that generates charts used in the report

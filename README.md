# US Domestic Flights Visualization and Analysis 

This project is part of my internship portfolio and showcases my skills in data visualization, Python programming, and interactive dashboard creation.

## Project Overview

Using flight data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, I built an interactive dashboard and various visualizations to analyze domestic air travel patterns. The project focuses on:

- Outbound flight volume by airport
- Distance vs. average fare by airline market share
- Interactive geo plots using Plotly
- Dashboard rendering using Dash and Plotly Express

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

**US Airline Flight Routes and Fares (1993–2024)**  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/us-airline-flight-routes-and-fares-1993-2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/us-airline-flight-routes-and-fares-1993-2024)

This dataset includes:
- Origin and destination airports
- Distance in miles
- Fare and carrier information
- Year and quarter

The data was filtered to focus on outbound flights from U.S. airports in 2018.
